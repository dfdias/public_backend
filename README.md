# Siacua-Gamification

This git will have all the further developing of the SIACUA's learning plataform game branch

At first the code will only be a simple backend script that extracts information from SIACUA's database and re-sorts it to fit the game's needs and saves it into a custom database and generates(temporarly) html files with scoreboards.

The objective is to create a mature gui.
